# Terraform Configuration (Not Recommended)

This directory contains the original Terraform configuration.

**Note**: This configuration has compatibility issues with current AWS provider versions. Resource types like `aws_connect_rule` and `aws_lexv2models_bot_alias` are not supported.

**Recommended**: Use CloudFormation deployment instead.

See `../cloudformation/` directory for working deployment.
